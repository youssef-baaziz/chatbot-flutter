# flutter_chat_app

A simple Flutter chat app with authentication and sidebar navigation.

## Features

- **Login Screen**: Simple login with username and password.  
  - Default credentials:  
    - Username: `admin`  
    - Password: `admin`
  - Only these credentials will allow you to log in; any other username or password will not work.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Access different screens using a custom sidebar (drawer).
- **Chat Screen**: Chat with an AI assistant (powered by OpenAI API).
- **Loading Indicator**: See a "Thinking..." bubble while the AI is generating a response.
- **User Experience**: Clean UI, easy navigation, and helpful assistant.

## How it works

1. **Login**:  
   When you open the app, you must log in using the default credentials above.  
   If you enter an incorrect username or password, you will not be able to proceed to the app.

2. **Sidebar**:  
   After logging in, you can use the sidebar to navigate between Home and Chat screens.

3. **Chat**:  
   The chat screen lets you talk to the AI.  
   When you send a message, you'll see a "Thinking..." indicator while the AI prepares a response.  
   The AI can answer questions and help you with various topics.
